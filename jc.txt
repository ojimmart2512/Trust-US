Database Specialist & Project Coordinator?
I honestly struggled to try and push my stuff into the actual repo but it eventually happened. 
The overall goals for the project is to have something presentable and functionable. Emaphasis on the
functionable. This website seems like a lot but that's the upside for when we finish it. We can say that
we were able to finish it.
I'll try to help Omar in anyway I can with the basic js and, if needed, try to help with the css/design stuff.
