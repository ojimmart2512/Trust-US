Today, Mirella and I worked together to start drafting our website design on Canva. 
As the frontend specialist, I want to plan everything I can for the UI as soon as 
possible so neither of us have to worry about the details down the road. I am 
responsible for the UI and ensuring a good user experience. This will include
responsive resign and form validation and RegEx. The biggest challenge in the 
beginning was just planning and mapping out the website. My goal is to learn
more about making simple yet effective page that doesn't get too convuluted.
Tomorrow, I will start drafting a timeline and finish the page mock up.
